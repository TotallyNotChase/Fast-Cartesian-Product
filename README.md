# Fast-Cartesian-Product
An algorithm to calculate any given index of a cartesian product.
Suppose we have 3 sets - 
* A : {1, 2, 3}
* B : {2, 6, 7, 9}
* C : {1, 7}

Simply call `get_tuple_by_index` and pass in the list/array of sets (i.e `[A, B, C]` or `{A, B, C}`) and the index of the result you want.
